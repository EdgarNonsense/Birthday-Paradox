How are birthdays represented in this program? (Hint: look at line 16.)
* 365 birthdays are reprented in this birthday, starting from January 1, 2001.
How could you remove the maximum limit of 100 birthdays the program generates?
* By changing line 56 "if response.isdecimal() and (0 < int(response) <= 100):" so that it doesn't have the portion after the and.
What error message do you get if you delete or comment out numBDays = int(response) on line 57?
* NameError because numBDays would not be described
How can you make the program display full month names, such as 'January' instead of 'Jan'?
* Change line 50 so that months have their full name
How could you make 'X simulations run...' appear every 1,000 simulations instead of every 10,000?
* change line 95 from "if i % 10_000 == 0:" to "if i % 1_000 == 0:"
